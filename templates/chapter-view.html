        The wind hunted down Rue Saint-Paul like something with a face, shouldering through Old Montreal's narrow arteries and making the tin cigarette sign in the alley shriek against its rusted chains. Each gust turned the metal into a mad percussion section, a clang and rattle riding the February storm's savage rhythm.

        Sam Chevalier pulled his overcoat tighter, the wool heavy with the promise of snow. He'd chosen this route deliberately—the back way, through the service entrance that smelled of stale beer and yesterday's cigarettes. Neutrality had been his currency for years, a carefully maintained distance from the city's darker currents. Tonight, that distance felt thinner than the ice forming on the cobblestones.

        Le Spectre Bleu waited ahead, its neon sign flickering like a dying heartbeat. The club had been his sanctuary, a place where music and shadows could coexist without judgment. But as he pushed through the heavy door, something in the silence made his pulse quicken.

          Sam discovers Juliette's brutally murdered body in Le Spectre Bleu after hours, shattering his carefully constructed world. Through grief-stricken flashbacks, we witness their passionate secret relationship and the club's atmosphere before this devastating discovery transforms Sam from neutral businessman to hunted man, as his violent nature surfaces in his grief.

        The stage was empty, the piano silent. But there, draped across the keys like a broken marionette, was Juliette. Her hand still rested on middle C, fingers curled in a final, desperate chord. The "Rouge Fatale" nail polish she'd worn last night—the color he'd teased her about—now looked like blood against the ivory.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-4 text-justify">
        Her arm was bent at an impossible angle, the crimson dress he'd watched her choose now soaked through. The stage lights, left on from last night's performance, cast everything in a harsh, unforgiving glow. Sam's breath caught in his throat, a sound that was half sob, half curse.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-4 text-justify">
        The glass shattered. A sound ripped up from somewhere animal. Not the measured man he performed. A broken, raw roar that uncaged the beast he'd kept smothered under Savile Row and quiet diplomacy.
